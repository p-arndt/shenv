// Package buildinfo exposes the binary's version metadata.
//
// The values default to a "dev" build and are overridden at release time via
// the Go linker, e.g.
//
//	go build -ldflags "-X shenv/internal/buildinfo.Version=1.2.3 \
//	                   -X shenv/internal/buildinfo.Commit=abc1234 \
//	                   -X shenv/internal/buildinfo.Date=2026-07-01T12:00:00Z"
//
// The release pipeline reads the version from the repo-root VERSION file (the
// single source of truth) and injects it here. See .github/workflows/release.yml.
